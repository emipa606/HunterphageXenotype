Adds a new xenotype "The Hunterphage" in your rimworld playthrough, along with new weapons and apparels to use, new buildings to research and build, new items and drugs to abuse, and a faction that you can interact or conquer.

The hunterphage xenotype is inspired by my favorite game growing up "Dungeon Blitz", preferably the rogue discipline "Shadow Stalker". Some of its abilities are paying homage to my most used rogue discipline, and its abilities are a little bit crazy, but hey, so is the Shadow Stalker that the xenotype is paying homage to.

The rest, like weapons and apparels, are referencing other games, and what are these games you ask? Well, it's up to your eagle eyed vision to spot those references :3

I bet you're wondering and ask why I made this mod in the first place eh? The answer is, well, for fun ofc. I just want to play as a bad-ass hunter with shadow stalker abilities, and create a hunters covenant to dominate other neighboring factions, all while looking good doing it.

The Hunterphage mod is just a precursor of other projects I have in mind, so look forward to it!

Q: Is it safe to add mid-save?
A: Probably, but the faction wont appear if you do. But I bet you can fix it with a few mods.

Q: Is it CE compatible?
A: No, I don't make CE patches, sorry. Please ask the authors of CE instead.

Q: Do you take commissions?
A: I sure am! Just message me on Rimworld Discord, or DM me on Discord https://discord.com/invite/rimworld.
