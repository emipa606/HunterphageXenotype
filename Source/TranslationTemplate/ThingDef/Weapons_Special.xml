During the early founding of the hunters covenant, the hunterphages discovered breech-loading technology and are determined to mass produce breech-loading firearms for the hunters, but due to the lack of resources and expenses, only a single breech-loading rifle was created where it was modified and used by the founder of the covenant. Later down the road, they have reached the point where they could mass produce breech-loading firearms, but was later abandoned after discovering revolver tech firearms, so only a single breech-loading firearm was created in the history of the hunters covenant. Although breech-loading firearms were abandoned, several gunsmiths produced a handful of replicas of the original weapon as a form of revering their original founder, therefore , only a handful of the santiago replicas can be found throughout the rim. -->
